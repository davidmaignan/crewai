To fully comprehend the scenario described, we need to delve into the mathematics concerning the expression \((z^3 + 8) / (z^2 - 4)\).

Let's start by evaluating each part of the equation individually:

1. **Numerator \(z^3 + 8 = 0\):**  
   This equation is a simple cubic equation. To find the value of \(z\) that satisfies this equation, we set:
   \[
   z^3 + 8 = 0 \implies z^3 = -8 \implies z = -2 
   \]
   Therefore, when \(z = -2\), the numerator equals zero, fulfilling its part of the equation.

2. **Denominator \(z^2 - 4 = 0\):**  
   The denominator is a quadratic equation, specifically a difference of squares, which can be factored as follows:
   \[
   z^2 - 4 = (z - 2)(z + 2) = 0
   \]
   Solving this gives the solutions:
   \[
   z = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad z = -2
   \]
   Notice that when \(z = -2\), the denominator becomes zero, indicating that the expression becomes indeterminate at this point.

3. **Expression \((z^3 + 8) / (z^2 - 4)\):**  
   When evaluating the entire fraction for \(z = -2\), we encounter a 0/0 form, which is undefined in standard arithmetic. It tells us that at \(z = -2\), the fraction does not produce a determinate value.

4. **Indeterminacy and Valid Solutions:**  
   Since the fraction (i.e., the expression \((z^3 + 8) / (z^2 - 4) = 0\)) becomes indeterminate when \(z = -2\) due to the division by zero, there are no values of \(z\) satisfying this equation that do not result in a zero denominator. 

Thus, summarizing the situation: while \(z\) removes the zero negation in the numerator, it simultaneously invokes a division by zero in the denominator, rendering the fraction undefined. Hence, no valid solutions exist for this scenario where the whole expression can equate to zero without causing a zero in the denominator. This illustrates the critical role of both numerator and denominator calculations in determining the validity of function expressions in algebra.
